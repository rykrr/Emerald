## Now in Rust!

Emerald is a GameBoy Emulator written in Rust.  
  
It features:  
- An explicit bus!
- A mostly functional CPU!
- A somewhat functional PPU! (Sprites not included)
- A disturbing lack of sound!
- Console serial output!
- ROM only cartridges!
- A TODO comment where Joypad support should be!
