## Now in Rust!

Emerald is a GameBoy Emulator written in Rust.  
  
It features:  
- An explicit bus!
- A mostly functional CPU!
- A somewhat functional PPU! (Sprites now included!)
- A disturbing lack of sound!
- Console serial output!
- ROM only cartridges!

Todo:
- Fix sprite flickering.
- Fix timings.
- Optimize emulation (current implementation is much slower than C++ implementation)
  
  
> Insanity is doing thing same thing, over and over again, but expecting different results.

This is attempt #5 at a working emulator.
